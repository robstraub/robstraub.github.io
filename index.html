	Hey whoever is reading this, my name is Rob Straub and I am a huge fan of dogs. Despite me having the inability to own one due to living under my parents roof when im not at UB, my love for them stays true. My favorite dog is a huskie and my least favorite is none because dogs are awesome. I am bitchlingual which means I can inform the people of my kingdom while also putting a bitch in their place if needed.  <p>
