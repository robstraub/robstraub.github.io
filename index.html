	<title>Rob Straub, the name that rhymed</title>
	<h1> Rob Straub </h1>
	<p id="first-paragraph"> Hey whoever is reading this, my name is Rob Straub and I am a huge fan of dogs. Despite me having the inability to own one due to living under my parents roof when im not at UB, my love for them stays true. My favorite dog is a huskie and my least favorite is none because dogs are awesome.</p>
		<p>Another thing I am very passionate about is music. Not paticularly playing music but listening to music. I know pretty much anyone living has music they listen to but I feel as if I go beyond just listening, through all my playlists and songs downloaded I have over 74 hrs of music and I can generally tell you what song is which by just a few seconds of listening. In no paticular order here are my favorite artists currently. </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Fleetwood Mac</li>
				<li>Lorde</li>
				<li>Queen</li>
				<li>Marina and The Diamonds</li>
				<li>Alt-J</li>
				<li>FKA Twigs</li>
			</ul>
